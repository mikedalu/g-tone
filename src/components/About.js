			<p>
				Just a little indication. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Let's put some
				highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. In this world, everything can be happy. Let's make a nice big
				leafy tree. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.
				In your world you can create anything you desire.
